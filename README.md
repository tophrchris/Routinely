# Routinely

Routinely is a tool to help you establish, track, and understand your daily routine. Use Routinely to quickly and easily set goals for each of the tasks and habits that make up your day, and then track your completion of those goals. Routinely can send you notifications to remind you to complete your goals, and provides a history view to review past days. 

Each goal has a name, an abbreviation (you can use emoji to liven up your routine!), and a target time. Goals can also have alternative targets for different days of the week. Routinely will track your average completion time for each goal, and let you know when you’re on a completion streak. You can create custom goals, or choose from a library of suggestions. 

Routinely uses 3D Touch (when available) to give you quick access to creating new goals, and completing your ‘most recent’ and ‘next upcoming’ goal. You can swipe to access frequently used features for each goal, use Pop/Peek to quickly review goal information, and search for goals using spotlight.

# Work in progress!

Routinely is a work in progress-  this is my first iOS application, and I fully expect it to have bruises, bumps, and wrinkles.  Please feel free to report code quality or functional issues here. Also, there is a [user-facing forum for reporting bugs or feature requests](https://feedback.userreport.com/53185834-9060-4b7d-a0b4-bd811e5a2a6e#ideas/popular).
